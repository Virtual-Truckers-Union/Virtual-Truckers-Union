As the VTU is running low on developers and hasn't been as active recently,
I decided to implement a system whereby the non-tech staff can easily post news articles and create new pages.  

### Hold on, is the old site going?
Hold your horses! No it is not... This site will be accessible via the main site where this one will act as a blog system - a way for people to easily update things and create events!
